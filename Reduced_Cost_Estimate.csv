Narrative of changes:
As I have not yet any experience on the application performance and the required scaling, I am still staying with the on-demand ec2 instances. Instead I changed the database from multi-AZ to single-AZ.
We have a read replica in a different AZ which we can promote in case of problems with the AZ of the master db.
